## Challenges - Bash Scripting Basics

#### Challenge #1

1. Suppose you connect frequently to a server located in a remote data center by running: ssh -l u123h -p 9956 191.169.0.1
2. Create an alias named main for the command and make it persistent after reboot.

- $ vim ~/.bashrc

- Append to the end:
"""
alias main="ssh -l u123h -p 9956 191.169.0.1"
"""


#### Challenge #2

1. Create a Bash script named script1.sh. Add the shebang.
2. Define a variable called country that holds the country you are living in.
3. Print the message: You live in YOUR_COUNTRY.
4. Run the script in different ways.

- $ vim script_chanllange2.sh
- code: /scripts_playground/script_chanllange2.sh
- $ chmod +x script_chanllange2.sh
- $ ./script_chanllange2.sh

#### Challenge #3

1. Create a script and define two string variables.
2. Add a commented line after the shebang and another inline comment.
3. Create a new variable by concatenating the two string variables.
4. Run the script.

- $ vim script_chanllange3.sh
- code: /scripts_playground/script_chanllange3.sh
- $ chmod +x script_chanllange3.sh
- $ ./script_chanllange3.sh

#### Challenge #4

1. Develop a Bash script that creates a new group and a new username. The group will be the userâ€™s secondary group.
2. The username and the group will be given as input by the user that runs the script.
3. The script will also display the last 2 lines from the files where the users and the groups are saved in Linux.
4. Test the script by running it as root.

- $ vim script_chanllange4.sh
- code: /scripts_playground/script_chanllange4.sh
- $ chmod +x script_chanllange4.sh
- $ ./script_chanllange4.sh


#### Challenge #5

1. Create a script called fix_permissions.sh that prompts the user for a directory and changes the permissions of all subdirectories to 755 and to all files to 644 recursively.

- $ vim script_chanllange5.sh
- code: /scripts_playground/script_chanllange5.sh
- $ chmod +x script_chanllange5.sh
- $ ./script_chanllange5.sh
